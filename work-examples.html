              SpaceX Dragon was an individual project I was assigned in a
              internet technology course . The longterm goal of this project was
              to develop a website with the skills I have learned from the
              course so far. While developing this site, my knowledge of image
              optimization, content structuring, and styling capablilites were
              tested. This site was comepleted approximately on February 26,
              2019. In terms of takeaways, or things I learned from developing
              this site, I learned that using an image gallery plug-in is a much
              more effecient option than coding completely from scratch. I
              desired to have a scrolling image gallery on the site, and I
              mangaged to make it happen using CSS keyframes, however, I later
              discovered that using a plug in would have provided the same
              result and would have required much less development time, which
              could have been put to use in other areas of the site. Overall, I
              was pleased with the outcome of the site.

              The Saucy Pie was a team project I was assigned in the same
              internet technology course. The longterm goal of this project was
              to develop a website with the skills I have learned from the
              course so far, while also collaborating with my classmates to
              build a site that was both pleasing to the eye and meet the
              requirements of our clients.

          <p class="par">
            This is my most recent project. Along with several other team
            members I worked to create a website for the non-profit
            organization, Indivisible Central Arkansas. Indivisible's goal is to
            empower people of all ages to exercise their voting rights as well
            help provide them the tools and information to do so. This website
            was developed on the popular CMS platform, Squarespace. My role as
            the developer and designer was to assist my team members in the
            creation of design elements such as a new logo and other graphic
            elements to be used on fliers, emails, etc. I was also responsible
            for implementing the layout of the content based on the wireframes
            provided to me by the co-designer.
          </p>
          <p class="par">
            I gained much development and designing experience while working on
            this project. I learned Content Managment Systems (CMS) are great
            tools to develop websites especially for people who are not very
            knowledgeable in coding languages. Speaking of which, this forced me
            to learn to communicate with people who are not fluent in web
            technologies and use jargon they can understand, so we all can
            understand each other and accomplish the our goals. Working on this
            project was very rewarding, however very frustrating at times. I
            learned that not all CMS platforms are created equally and they each
            come with their own limitations. This was my first time developing
            with SquareSpace and I often found myself comparing it to another
            popular CMS, WordPress, which is my preferred CMS. Developing this
            site using SquareSpace was challenging at times because I often
            encountered technical roadblocks such as the SquareSpace server
            having issues or a certain feature not functioning as it should.
          </p>
          <p class="par">
            Overall I am very satisfied with how they site turned out. While
            SquareSpace is not my preferred CMS I am grateful I got to gain some
            experience using it and gaining a good understaning of its
            innerworking since it could be the preferred platform of clients
            someday.
